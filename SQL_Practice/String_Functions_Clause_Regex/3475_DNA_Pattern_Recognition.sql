3475. DNA Pattern Recognition
Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/dna-pattern-recognition/description/

Table: Samples
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    | 
+----------------+---------+
| sample_id      | int     |
| dna_sequence   | varchar |
| species        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
sample_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains a DNA sequence represented as a string of characters (A, T, G, C) 
and the species it was collected from.
Biologists are studying basic patterns in DNA sequences. 
Write a solution to identify sample_id with the following patterns:

Sequences that start with ATG (a common start codon)
Sequences that end with either TAA, TAG, or TGA (stop codons)
Sequences containing the motif ATAT (a simple repeated pattern)
Sequences that have at least 3 consecutive G (like GGG or GGGG)
Return the result table ordered by sample_id in ascending order.
*/
# Solution 
select sample_id, dna_sequence, species,
--- '^ATG': specify the sequence starts with ATG and case-sensitive
--- 'TAA$|TAG$|TGA$' ends with TAA/TAG/TGA and case-sensitive
--- 'ATAT.*' has ATAT & can be followed by any sequence of characters
--- 'G{3,}' contains at least 3 Gs and case-sensitive
    regexp_like(dna_sequence, '^ATG', 'c') as has_start,
    regexp_like(dna_sequence, 'TAA$|TAG$|TGA$', 'c') as has_stop,
    regexp_like(dna_sequence, 'ATAT.*', 'c') as has_atat,
    regexp_like(dna_sequence, 'G{3,}', 'c') as has_ggg
from Samples
order by sample_id asc;

Test Case
Samples = 
| sample_id | dna_sequence    | species   |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- |
| 1         | ATGCTAGCTAGCTAA | Human     |
| 2         | GGGTCAATCATC    | Human     |
| 3         | ATATATCGTAGCTA  | Human     |
| 4         | ATGGGGTCATCATAA | Mouse     |
| 5         | TCAGTCAGTCAG    | Mouse     |
| 6         | ATATCGCGCTAG    | Zebrafish |
| 7         | CGTATGCGTCGTA   | Zebrafish |
Output
| sample_id | dna_sequence    | species   | has_start | has_stop | has_atat | has_ggg |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
