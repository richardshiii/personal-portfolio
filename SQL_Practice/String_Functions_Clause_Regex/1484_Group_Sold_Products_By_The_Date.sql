There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

# Solution
select sell_date, 
    count(distinct product) as num_sold, 
    -- Use group_concat to concatenate product names and sort them lexicographically
    group_concat(distinct product order by product ASC) as products
from Activities
group by sell_date
order by sell_date ASC;
