# Solution
select s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, 
    count(e.subject_name) as attended_exams -- Count the number of attended exams for each student and subject
from Students s
cross join Subjects sub -- Create a Cartesian product of Students and Subjects
left join Examinations e -- Use left join to include all students and subjects, even if no exams were attended
on s.student_id = e.student_id
and sub.subject_name = e.subject_name -- Match students with their attended exams
group by s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
order by s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
