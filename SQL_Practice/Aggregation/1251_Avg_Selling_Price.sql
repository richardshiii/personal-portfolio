# Solution
select p.product_id, 
    ifnull(round(sum(p.price * u.units) / sum(u.units), 2), 0) 
    as average_price -- Calculate the average price by multiplying price with units sold,
                     -- summing up, and dividing by total units sold, 
                     -- rounded to 2 decimal places.
from Prices p 
left join UnitsSold u
on p.product_id = u.product_id 
and u.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id;
