Difficulty: Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-books-with-polarized-opinions/

Table: books
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| book_id     | int     |
| title       | varchar |
| author      | varchar |
| genre       | varchar |
| pages       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
book_id is the unique ID for this table.
Each row contains information about a book including its genre and page count.

Table: reading_sessions
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| session_id     | int     |
| book_id        | int     |
| reader_name    | varchar |
| pages_read     | int     |
| session_rating | int     |
+----------------+---------+
session_id is the unique ID for this table.
Each row represents a reading session where someone read a portion of a book. 
session_rating is on a scale of 1-5.
Write a solution to find books that have polarized opinions - 
books that receive both very high ratings and very low ratings from different readers.

A book has polarized opinions if it has at least one rating ≥ 4 and at least one rating ≤ 2
Only consider books that have at least 5 reading sessions
Calculate the rating spread as (highest_rating - lowest_rating)
Calculate the polarization score as the number of extreme ratings (ratings ≤ 2 or ≥ 4) divided by total sessions
Only include books where polarization score ≥ 0.6 (at least 60% extreme ratings)
Return the result table ordered by polarization score in descending order, then by title in descending order.

# Solution 
select b.book_id, b.title, b.author, b.genre, b.pages,
-- calcuate the rating spread as the max. session rating - the minimum session rating
max(s.session_rating) - min(s.session_rating) as rating_spread,
-- use case when to count extreme ratings for each book and calculte polarization score
round(sum(case when session_rating >= 4 or session_rating <= 2 then 1 else 0 end) / count(session_rating), 2) as polarization_score
from books b
join reading_sessions s on b.book_id = s.book_id
group by book_id, title, author, genre, pages
-- only include books with at least 5 reading sessions
having count(session_rating) >= 5
-- make sure books have both extreme high and low ratings to qualify
-- deal with edge cases that a book may only have extreme high/low ratings
and sum(case when session_rating >= 4 then 1 else 0 end) >= 1
and sum(case when session_rating <= 2 then 1 else 0 end) >= 1
-- only include books with score >= 0.6
and polarization_score >= 0.6
order by polarization_score desc, title desc;
