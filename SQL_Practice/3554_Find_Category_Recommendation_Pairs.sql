Amazon wants to understand shopping patterns across product categories. Write a solution to:

Find all category pairs (where category1 < category2)
For each category pair, determine the number of unique customers who purchased products from both categories
A category pair is considered reportable if at least 3 different customers have purchased products from both categories.

Return the result table of reportable category pairs ordered by customer_count in descending order, 
and in case of a tie, by category1 in ascending order lexicographically, and then by category2 in ascending order.
