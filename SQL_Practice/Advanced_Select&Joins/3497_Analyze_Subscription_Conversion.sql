3497. Analyze Subscription Conversion
Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/analyze-subscription-conversion/description/

Table: UserActivity
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    | 
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| activity_date    | date    |
| activity_type    | varchar |
| activity_duration| int     |
+------------------+---------+
(user_id, activity_date, activity_type) is the unique key for this table.
activity_type is one of ('free_trial', 'paid', 'cancelled').
activity_duration is the number of minutes the user spent on the platform that day.
Each row represents a user's activity on a specific date.
A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, 
after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. Write a solution to:

Find users who converted from free trial to paid subscription
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.
*/
# Solution
-- build trial_avg_duration table
with trial as (
    select user_id, round(avg(activity_duration), 2) as trial_avg_duration
    from UserActivity
    where activity_type = 'free_trial'
    group by user_id
),
-- build paid_avg_duration table
paid as (
    select user_id, round(avg(activity_duration), 2) as paid_avg_duration
    from UserActivity
    where activity_type = 'paid'
    group by user_id
)
-- select necessary columns from each table and join them together
select user_id, trial_avg_duration, paid_avg_duration
from trial
join paid
using (user_id)
order by user_id;
