Difficulty: Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-consistently-improving-employees/description/

Table: employees
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about an employee.

Table: performance_reviews
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| review_id   | int  |
| employee_id | int  |
| review_date | date |
| rating      | int  |
+-------------+------+
review_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a performance review for an employee. 
The rating is on a scale of 1-5 where 5 is excellent and 1 is poor.
Write a solution to find employees who have consistently improved their performance over their last three reviews.

An employee must have at least 3 review to be considered
The employee's last 3 reviews must show strictly increasing ratings (each review better than the previous)
Use the most recent 3 reviews based on review_date for each employee
Calculate the improvement score as the difference between the latest rating and the earliest rating among the last 3 reviews
Return the result table ordered by improvement score in descending order, then by name in ascending order.

# Solution 
-- sort each employee's ratings by review date
with rank_date as (
select p.employee_id, e.name, p.review_date, p.rating, 
    rank() over (partition by p.employee_id order by p.review_date desc) as ranks
from performance_reviews p
join employees e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
),
-- find 3 most recent reviews for each employee
top_three as (
select employee_id, name,
-- use max() to find maximum value for each group (employee)
-- case when () is not an aggregate function
-- pivot ranked data so each employee's ratings are in the same row
-- rank 1 indicates latest rating, rank 2 indicate 2nd-latest rating, 
-- rank 3 indicates third-latest rating
max(case when ranks = 1 then rating end) as latest_rating,
max(case when ranks = 2 then rating end) as sec_rating,
max(case when ranks = 3 then rating end) as third_rating
from rank_date
group by employee_id, name
)
-- improvement score is the difference b/t latest and third-latest rating
select employee_id, name, (latest_rating - third_rating) as improvement_score
from top_three
where 
-- most recent 3 ratings can't be null
latest_rating is not null and 
sec_rating is not null and 
third_rating is not null and
-- latest rating > sec_rating & sec_rating > third_rating 
-- ensures continuous improvement
latest_rating > sec_rating and
sec_rating > third_rating
order by improvement_score desc, name asc;
