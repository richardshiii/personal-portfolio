1907. Count Salary Categories
Difficulty: Medium

Table: Accounts
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

    output = pd.DataFrame({"category": ["Low Salary", "Average Salary", "High Salary"], "accounts_count": [
        # Count accounts with income < 20000
        accounts[accounts.income < 20000].shape[0],
        # Count accounts with income in the range [20000, 50000]
        accounts[(accounts.income >= 20000) & (accounts.income <= 50000)].shape[0],
        # Count accounts with income > 50000
        accounts[accounts.income > 50000].shape[0]
    ]})
    
    return output
